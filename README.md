# Production Machine Learning Systems

In real-world production ML systems are large ecosystems of which a  robust model code itself is just a small part. The rest, consist of code that perform critical functions some of which we have already seen in the pipeline in my [last repo](https://github.com/Sylar257/Google-Cloud-Platform-with-Tensorflow). In this project, we will be learning good characteristics that make for good ML system beyond its ability to make *good predictions*.
